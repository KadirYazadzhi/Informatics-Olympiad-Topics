# 🔢 Numeral Systems, Big Integers, and Random Numbers

## 🔢 Numeral Systems
A numeral system is a method of representing numbers using symbols. The most commonly used system is the decimal system, which uses ten digits (0-9). Besides it, common ones are:

- **Binary system** – uses only 0 and 1, widely used in computer technologies.
- **Octal system** – uses digits 0-7, used mostly in old computer systems and some computing devices.
- **Hexadecimal system** – uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F, finds application in programming, color codes, and machine language.

## History and Significance
Different numeral systems emerged depending on the needs of civilizations. For example, Babylonians used a sexagesimal numeral system, while Romans used their system of Roman numerals. Nowadays, the binary system is the basis of digital technologies, making understanding it critically important for programmers and engineers.

### Converting Between Numeral Systems
Converting between different numeral systems is a basic operation. For example, when converting from decimal to binary, the number is divided by 2, and the remainders are recorded in reverse order. From binary to decimal, the sum of powers of 2 for each digit is used. From decimal to hexadecimal, division by 16 is performed.

Example of converting the number `45` to binary:
```
45 / 2 = 22 remainder 1
22 / 2 = 11 remainder 0
11 / 2 = 5 remainder 1
5 / 2 = 2 remainder 1
2 / 2 = 1 remainder 0
1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1
```
Result: `101101`

There are also algorithms for direct conversion between different systems, such as Horner's method, which allows fast calculation without the need for an intermediate decimal value.

## 🧮 Big Integers (Long Numbers)
Big integers are numbers that exceed the capacity of standard data types like `int` and `long`. They are processed as arrays or strings to perform arithmetic operations.

### Representation of Big Integers
Since standard types have a limited size (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit `int`), big integers are usually stored as arrays of digits or strings. Special algorithms are applied for processing them.

### Arithmetic Operations
When adding two big integers, they are treated as character strings, processing them digit by digit from right to left. Similarly for multiplication, where digit-by-digit multiplication with carry is used.

Example of adding big integers:
```
12345678901234567890
+ 98765432109876543210
----------------------
 111111111011111111100
```

The method for multiplying big integers resembles the standard method for multiplication by hand, performing operations for each digit and summing the intermediate results. A more optimized variant is using the Karatsuba algorithm, which divides numbers into parts and reduces the number of necessary operations.

## 🎲 Random Numbers
Random numbers are numbers that do not follow a specific pattern and are generated by an algorithm or physical process. In computer science, they are generated via:
- **Pseudo-random generators** – algorithms that simulate randomness (e.g., Linear Congruential Generator).
- **True random numbers** – based on physical phenomena such as radioactive decay, electronic circuit noise, and atmospheric fluctuations.

### Generating Random Numbers
In different programming languages, built-in functions can be used to generate random numbers.

Example in **Python**:
```python
import random
print(random.randint(1, 100))
```

Example in **C++**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
int main() {
    std::srand(std::time(0));
    std::cout << rand() % 100 + 1 << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Random Number Distributions
Random numbers can follow different distributions such as:
- **Uniform distribution** – all numbers in a given interval have equal probability.
- **Normal distribution** – common in nature and statistics, characterized by concentration around the mean value.
- **Exponential distribution** – used to model time intervals between independent events.

## 🏁 Conclusion
Understanding numeral systems, big integers, and random numbers is fundamental in computer science and mathematics. Knowing different number representations, efficient algorithms for working with large numbers, and methods for generating random values helps in software development, cryptography, statistical analyses, and simulations. Mastering these concepts ensures a better understanding of computational processes and leads to optimizing complex algorithms. 🚀
